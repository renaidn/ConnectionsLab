## <b>Project Proposal</b>

For this project the two of us teamed up to make a game inspired by many collaborative games we have played together (It Takes Two, A Way Out, Pico Park). The game we are looking to make is a two player game, where players will need to work as a team to complete a level. Levels will be structured in such way that players won't be able to complete the level on their own. Players can either create the room or join one, where they will be assigned a character at random. Each of the characters have their own special ability: one can move chair boxes, while the other one can jump for a longer distance. Jumping from a yellow block onto the chair allows for the chair to act as a trampoline and enhance the jump of a player. Players must collect a key in order to open the door to the next level. There are four levels in total. First three levels are easy and are serving the function of a tutorial level to make the players get comfortable with the game. Fourth level is comprised of everything that the players have encountered in the first three levels, making it the most challenging one to complete. Players are free to use either arrow keys or WASD keys. Additionally, spacebar key may be used for jumping if that's what the player prefers.

## <b>Process</b>

### <i>Division of Responsibilities</i>

When dividing the responsibilities, we took into account both the our strengths and the necessity of the equal division in the design and coding aspects. This is the list of responsibilities we came up with:
