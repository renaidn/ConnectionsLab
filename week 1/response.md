Connected Application of my choice - Notion, a popular note-taking and project management software.
I have first attempted to use notion for a few hours yesterday and I had a great experience with it. I have got to use most of its basic functionalities except for the collaborative one, which I expect to be similar to that of google apps’. A few things that I liked are:
* the aesthetical pleasure that you get from the experience. Notion’s design is simple and is built in a way that it would probably be rather challenging for a user to create something hideous. It does so by giving the user a limited choice of colors (10), fonts (3), and backgrounds (2), all of which are pretty neutral if you were to describe them in one word. Consequently, anything you create on there looks nice and clean, which gives the user an illusion of having their lives together. I believe that this application’s ability to create this sense of control and composure is one of the main reasons for which it is successful. I personally prefer aesthetics over functionality, so I appreciate this high-quality experience that notion delivers.
<br/> <br/>
* the wide range of functionality provided to the user. Notion gives its users a platform for what feels like a personal website, in which you can create several pages linked (or not) to one another. Users can create texts, lists, tables, databases, widgets, reusable templates, and more. From the name of it I have expected the Notion to be an Apple Notes app but on the web, however, it feels like a mix of Google apps (docs, sheets, calendar, and sites). Having all of this functionality in one place gives users much-appreciated freedom of creation. This month I have been in search of a mobile productivity application, which ended up pretty sad as I didn’t find anything that would be more than a to-do list emerged with a calendar. I appreciate how Notion does not restrict its users to a rigid framework. If I was to make a parallel with physical journals, I would say that Notion is a bullet journal, while most of the other similar software is dated diaries (which are a great fit for some, but I personally find them extremely uncomfortable and upsetting to use). 
<br/> <br/> Overall, I think that Notion is a very cool thing to start using. I admire its creators for their serve in both functional and aesthetical aspects. Some aspects of it that I find less appealing or would do differently are:
<br/> <br/>
* limited visual choices. I have earlier listed this point as a positive one, however, there is also a downside to it. Though I do think that the colors available at the moment are good and can be used beautifully by anyone, I would love some more creative freedom. When setting up my first notion pages I went to Pinterest for inspiration and most of the pins there just look so alike that it kind of deducts some points from the aesthetical aspect of the experience. With a limited choice in the visual aspect, it is difficult to create something unique and personal, which I believe is important. For this reason, I would suggest adding an option of choosing from a color wheel, a function to import fonts, and another function to change the background to a picture or color of choice. This way it would cater to a younger audience. However, since it’s listed as a project management software then perhaps it could be that these are the only visual options given for the workers to maintain the official and strict vibes more easily.
<br/> <br/>
* somehow complicated interface. Though it contradicts what I said earlier, Notion manages to look both simple and difficult at the same time (or maybe it’s just me). I find it rather tricky to use and will need some time to get used to it. In case Notion is made for office clerks, which I stereotypically imagine as older and less tech-savvy people, this is an issue. I suppose that it could be due to the fact that almost everything on the screen is clickable, so it is easy to misclick. In addition to the many shortcuts that are available there, accidental mess-ups with your work are something very possible and real.
