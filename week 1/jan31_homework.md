<b>Progress and Learnings</b>
<br>
	For this assignment I have done a webpage for a navigation video that I did for NYUAD Art Gallery last fall. Since I already have some experience with CSS and HTML from a Communications Lab that I took during summer of 2021, this assignment was mostly a refreshment of memory for me (and I have quite a bad one when it comes to coding). I have spent the most time figuring out the sizing of individual objects, which I did in percents instead of pixels for flexibility. I kind of have issues with using rem and em, which I would need to dedicate some separate time on later (or perhaps briefly cover it in some lab session if relevant). I also got reminded that making pageâ€™s dimensions responsive to the device is difficult and painful, and I was thankful that we did not need to make it responsive for this assignment.

  When making a wireframe, besides following the prompt and including a list of required objects, I knew that I wanted it to be: a no-scroll-page, focused on the video object. I think that no scroll format is good for webpages with a little amount of information on it. I have determined for myself that video should be at the center (figuratively, not literally) of the page because it is dedicated to a project that I have done, and the final product of my project was this video, so it must be the object that stands out on the page. You can see that I have followed these two personal wishes of mine on the final wireframe attached below.

  Overall, since it was more of a refresher than a learning experience, I did not learn much or felt any certain struggles or challenges.
