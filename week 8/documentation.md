# Project - Crayola Draw (but now for two and more people!)

For this assignment I have decided to come back to the project I have done earlier for this class and make it collaborative. Users can draw together! Exciting! 

# Functionality

User can choose brush size, color, and type. This choices are reflected accurately for each user. The canvas is made bigger because there are more users, hence more drawing space is needed. Canvas size and orientation functions were removed because with multiple users it wouldn't make sense to make canvas smaller.

# Challenges and reflection

As all of the brush options consist of tightly/loosely packed dots/lines, the speed with which the changes made by another user are displayed on the canvas is quite slow. The eraser brush somehow takes the longest to display. Sometimes, the sync is fast and accurate to the actual time when the change was made. But then when I reload the page it is back to being slow. I am not quite sure what is it that controls it. Despite that I happy with the outcome of this assignment. It is something that I wanted to implement but didn't expect myself to do so soon. Another thing that decreases the quality of the experience is the not responsiveness of the page size. I did not make it responsive initially, and now when testing the page from two half sized tabs, you can see how everything is distorted. So, testing on one computer is generally uncomfortable, which is definitely something to work on.
