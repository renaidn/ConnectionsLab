# Project 1 - CrayolaDraw
## <b>Project proposal:</b>
<p>For this project I am going to make a website that would utilize a json file with existing crayola colors to create a wholesome online drawing experience for its users. I am imagining my target audience to be people, who don't have the device capacity to use special professional drawing programs but want to see what digital drawing is. Middle school me would have been happy to find a program of this kind, because my laptop wasn't powerful enough to support graphic softwares, but I had a deep interest in digital art. Even though online drawing websites frequently have a rather limited functionality, it was a great starting point for me to pursue my interest and familiarize myself with a tricky drawing-with-your-mouse experience.</p>
	<br>As I don't feel too confident about my JavaScript language and p5 library knowledge at the moment, I am planning my website functionality accordingly. I expect my website to have:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a palette, which would feature crayola colors fetched from a json file;</li>
  <li>an artboard, on which the users will be able to draw;</li>
  <li>a set of tools like: eraser, pen, brush (different textures).</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>It would also be cool to add features like sharing the drawing on social media, option to save the drawing to the computer, and perhaps add more flexibility in brush properties.</p>

<p>After making a wireframe I have realized that there are some more cool features that could be added to this project, such as:
  <ul>
    <li>making several version of palette organization (by name, by color hue);</li>
    <li>make the artboard resizeable (4*4, 16*9, 4*3, landscape, portrait)</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>So far I have just implemented what I was told during our last lab session. I believe I will face more challenges later on, when implementing the drawing and responsive features.</p>
