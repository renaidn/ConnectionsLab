# Project 1 - week 1 - Progress
<b>Project proposal:</b>
<p>For this project I am going to make a website that would allow one to use existing crayola colors to draw online. My webpage will consist of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a palette, which would feature crayola colors fetched from a json file;</li>
  <li>an art board, on which the users will be able to draw;</li>
  <li>and a set of tools like: eraser, pen, brush (different textures).</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>I wouldn’t identify my main audience as kids, but rather people who want to draw online but can’t download any special programs. I chose this audience because it is something that I could relate to and that I’ve personally struggled with back when I had a less powerful computer. It would be cool to add features like sharing the drawing on social media, add more brushes and tools (like bucket), option to save the drawing to the computer. I would also like to attempt at making it somewhat responsive for comfortable use on phone, tablet, and laptop.</p>
